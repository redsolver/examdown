# Examdown

Forked from https://github.com/pldiiw/examdown, switched from `cmark` to `cmark-gfm`

> Write your exam with Markdown + AsciiMath, deliver a PDF

I sometimes need to write documents with equations in it. Word is way too
cumbersome to use. LaTeX is awesome but complex. Why not just use the
simplicity of Markdown syntax and intuitiveness of [AsciiMath] ? That's what
this little bash script provides.

## Install

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pldiiw/examdown.git
```

First, check that you have all the dependencies:

```
$ make -s checkdeps
getopt from util-linux 2.35.1
cmark-gfm 0.29.0.gfm.0 - CommonMark with GitHub Flavored Markdown converter
wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5
vendor/github-markdown-css/github-markdown.css
vendor/MathJax/MathJax.js
```

If the output looks like this, then you have all the dependencies needed.

If `cmark-gfm` is missing, install it with your favorite package manager,
like `pacman`:

```
$ sudo pacman -S cmark-gfm
```

Or get it here: https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm


If `wkhtmltopdf` is missing, install it with your favorite package manager,
like `pacman`:

```
$ sudo pacman -S wkhtmltopdf
```

If the two last ones are missing, just run these two commands:

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update --recursive
```

Now that you have all the dependencies, run `make -s build` to set up the hierarchy
needed for examdown to work.

```
$ make -s build
```

From there, you can run the tests to check that everything is ok:

```
$ make -s test
```

If the tests went right, you can now install the hierarchy generated by our
build recipe to `/usr/local` by default:

```
$ sudo make -s install
```

If you wish to install it somewhere else, just override the `PREFIX` variable:

```
$ make -s install PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
```

If you installed examdown to some gloomy path, like above, be sure that the
`bin` folder where `examdown` lies is in your `$PATH` variable.

Check that the installation worked:

```
$ examdown --help
```

You're done!

If you want to uninstall examdown, use the `uninstall` recipe:

```
$ sudo make -s uninstall
```

Do not forget to specify the `PREFIX` variable again if you modified it during
the installation.

## Usage

The following syntax is supported in the Markdown files:
 * CommonMark: http://commonmark.org/help/
 * Tables: https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-
 * Strikethrough: https://github.github.com/gfm/#strikethrough-extension-
 * Autolinks: https://github.github.com/gfm/#autolinks-extension-
 * Underlining using `~~`: `~~I'm underlined~~`
 * Equations using AsciiMath:  http://asciimath.org/ -- equations are delimited
   using `$`: `$x^2$`

See [test/test.md](test/test.md) for an example.
